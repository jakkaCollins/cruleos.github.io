<h1>CruleOS 1</h1>
<p>CruleOS is a Linux distribution aiming to provide a simple and easy use experience through a more traditional desktop, as well as utilising Flatpaks for easy application distribution, containerisation and updates as much as possible. CruleOS is built on-top of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to provide a stable base for your desktop.</p>

<h1>A more traditional desktop</h1>
<p>The GNOME desktop environment provides users with a simple and easy to use interface, however it breaks away from many traditional desktop conventions that people are used to. To provide a more traditional desktop experience, we have integrated some GNOME extensions, themes and tweaks to modify the default desktop experience into something more familiar, whilst still providing the user with a simple, workspace-orientated layout.</p>
<p>We have installed and utilised the <a href="https://github.com/home-sweet-gnome/dash-to-panel">Dash to Panel</a> GNOME extension so that the desktop will have a centralised task-bar. This will provide the user with a more familiar, traditional desktop experience. We use the <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1187179/">Matcha (Dark sea)</a> GTK and Shell theme, to provide a beautiful flat design theme for applications as well as the graphical shell. The <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1166289">Papirus</a> icon theme we use integrates with our GTK and Shell theme to provide modern, flat-style icons.</p>

<h1>Utilising Flatpaks</h1>
<p>CruleOS utilises Flatpak to provide a secure and easy-to-use application experience. Flatpak offers excellent features such as: containerisation, permissions management and the latest updates. Flatpak is extremely well supported on our distribution. We attempt to provide the smoothest Linux experience for both new and experienced users by integrating GNOME and Flatpak together. By default we have integrated Flatpak with GNOME Software so you are provided an easy method of application installation out of the box.</p>
<p>CruleOS also ships with Flatseal out of the box, to provide a graphical interface for managing permissions and file access for Flatpak applications. Thanks to the distribution-agnostic nature of Flatpak, we are able to provide the latest versions of applications despite using a Long-Term-Support release, as Flatpak applications already contain everything that they require to run the correct version.</p>

<h1>A stable base</h1>
<p>CruleOS is built on-top of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to provide a stable base for your desktop. Since CruleOS 1 will be supported until 2024, you will not need to worry about major upgrades or downtime, and have a Linux distribution that will <em>just work</em> for you. Since CruleOS utilises Flatpak, you will be able to get the latest updates to your applications as they release.</p>
