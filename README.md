# CruleOS - Website
A website for CruleOS, a brand-new Linux distribution aiming to provide a simple and easy use experience through a more traditional desktop, as well as utilising Flatpaks for easy application distribution, containerisation and updates as much as possible. CruleOS is built on-top of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to provide a stable base for your desktop.
